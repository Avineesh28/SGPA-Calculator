# SGPA & CGPA Calculator Web Application

## Overview

The **SGPA & CGPA Calculator** is a user-friendly web application built with **React.js**, designed to streamline the process of calculating and managing academic performance. Users can input their course credits and grades for each semester, and the application will automatically compute the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA). Additionally, it provides functionality to calculate the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) over multiple semesters and maintain a detailed report card for academic tracking.

This project showcases practical expertise in **front-end development, React.js, and academic data management**, making it ideal for **web development, educational technology, and software engineering portfolios**.
